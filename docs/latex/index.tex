This code is designed as a lightweight flightcontroller to fly small UAS.

Designed specifically to run the free\+RTOS real time operating system on a teensy 4~\newline
It supports multiple flight modes and craft types.~\newline
~\newline
 For control of the aircraft, hover envelope and geometric controller are options.\hypertarget{index_intro_sec}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{index_intro_sec}
By default the code intializes by spawning six threads\+: ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item actuators
\item attitude
\item imu
\item slow sensors
\item navigation
\item telemetry
\end{DoxyItemize}

Each thread is responsible for a diffrent high level tasks. Each high level task, has it own class that stores data related to said task.~\newline
 An object of that class is instatiated as a global variable in main to allow for data to accessed easily while maitaining code readability.~\newline
 RWLocks are used to prevent misreads/miswrites of data. ~\newline
~\newline
 configuration vaules are declared in \mbox{\hyperlink{config_8h}{config.\+h}} and set in main ~\newline
~\newline
 More information is availble in the documentation for each class.\hypertarget{index_author}{}\doxysection{Authors}\label{index_author}
