\item The use of inappropriate language, including in a community member\textquotesingle{}s nickname

The goal of the standards and moderation guidelines outlined here is to build and maintain a respectful community. We ask that you don’t just aim to be \char`\"{}technically unimpeachable\char`\"{}, but rather try to be your best self.

We value many things beyond technical expertise, including collaboration and supporting others within our community. Providing a positive experience for other community members can have a much more significant impact than simply providing the correct answer.\hypertarget{md_lib__adafruit__b_n_o055_code_of_conduct_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Our Responsibilities}\label{md_lib__adafruit__b_n_o055_code_of_conduct_autotoc_md3}
Project leaders are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject messages, comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any community member for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\hypertarget{md_lib__adafruit__b_n_o055_code_of_conduct_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Moderation}\label{md_lib__adafruit__b_n_o055_code_of_conduct_autotoc_md4}
Instances of behaviors that violate the Adafruit Community Code of Conduct may be reported by any member of the community. Community members are encouraged to report these situations, including situations they witness involving other community members.

You may report in the following ways\+:

In any situation, you may send an email to \href{mailto:support@adafruit.com}{\texttt{ support@adafruit.\+com}}.

On the Adafruit Discord, you may send an open message from any channel to all Community Helpers by tagging @community helpers. You may also send an open message from any channel, or a direct message to @kattni\#1507, @tannewt\#4653, @\+Dan Halbert\#1614, @cater\#2442, @sommersoft\#0222, or @\+Andon\#8175.

Email and direct message reports will be kept confidential.

In situations on Discord where the issue is particularly egregious, possibly illegal, requires immediate action, or violates the Discord terms of service, you should also report the message directly to Discord.

These are the steps for upholding our community’s standards of conduct.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Any member of the community may report any situation that violates the Adafruit Community Code of Conduct. All reports will be reviewed and investigated.
\item If the behavior is an egregious violation, the community member who committed the violation may be banned immediately, without warning.
\item Otherwise, moderators will first respond to such behavior with a warning.
\item Moderators follow a soft \char`\"{}three strikes\char`\"{} policy -\/ the community member may be given another chance, if they are receptive to the warning and change their behavior.
\item If the community member is unreceptive or unreasonable when warned by a moderator, or the warning goes unheeded, they may be banned for a first or second offense. Repeated offenses will result in the community member being banned.
