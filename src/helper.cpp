  /*
   * It's good to operate at a constant loop rate for filters to remain stable and whatnot. Interrupt routines running in the
   * background cause the loop rate to fluctuate. This function basically just waits at the end of every loop iteration until 
   * the correct time has passed since the start of the current loop for the desired loop rate in Hz. 2kHz is a good rate to 
   * be at because the loop nominally will run between 2.8kHz - 4.2kHz. This lets us have a little room to add extra computations
   * and remain above 2kHz, without needing to retune all of our filtering parameters scattered around this code.
